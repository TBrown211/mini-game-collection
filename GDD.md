## Game Design Document


**Define the desired gameplay. What are you making?**
We are making a 2-player co-op shooter game. One player is inside the car driving, trying to get to the end well; the other is on top of the car, shooting the monsters coming at the car/players.


**Outline an objective statement for the design. What emotional and gameplay goals are you striving for with this design? Why?**
We want the player to feel the adrenaline. Since monsters are coming at you and a time limit, we want the player not to feel stressed but to have adrenaline and want to get to the end fast before any monsters can come to kill you.

**Detail design rationale. What do you envision? How does this support the overall project/company goal?**
What we envision for our game is:
- Shooting (you get to use the gun and shoot the monsters down)
- Monster spawning (monsters are trying to kill the player(s) and they are coming at you)
- Timer (There is a time limit; if the players do not make it in time to the end, the game is over and the player loses.)
- Win/lose (at the end of the game, it will say if you lost or won.)
- Assets (for most of our game we will be adding assets.)
- By adding a Co-op game we believe it will add variety to the list of games as we think other groups might lean towards a competitive game 


**Cite all resources, tangible, informative, and transformative. Cite all resources used in planning and development including the basis project, assets, guides, tutorials, and use of generative AI.**
